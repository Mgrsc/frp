# frp
Looking for an easy way to get an instance of frp up and running? 
Look no further than this Github repository,
which contains the Dockerfile you need to build your own container image. What's more,
this Dockerfile is set up to automatically update, so you can be sure you're always running the latest version of frp.

If you don't want to build your own image, pre-built Docker images are also available for use. To access these, 
simply run 
`docker pull mgrsc/frps` 
`docker pull mgrsc/frpc`
to download the frps and frpc images respectively.
[docker hub frps](https://hub.docker.com/r/mgrsc/frps)
[docker hub frpc](https://hub.docker.com/r/mgrsc/frpc)
